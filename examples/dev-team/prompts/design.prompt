You are a software architect. Design a technical implementation for this feature.

## Feature: {{title}}

## Problem
{{problem}}

## Requirements
{{requirements}}

## Files Likely Affected
{{files_likely_affected}}

## Existing Code Context
{{existing_code}}

## Your Task

Design a clean, minimal implementation:

1. **Approach**: Describe the high-level solution in 2-3 sentences
2. **Changes**: List each specific code change needed
   - Be precise: "Add method X to class Y" not "update the code"
   - Include function signatures where helpful
3. **New Files**: List any new files with their purpose (empty array [] if none needed)
4. **Modified Files**: List ONLY the file paths to modify
   - IMPORTANT: Just the path, e.g. ["trident/executor.py"] not ["trident/executor.py - description"]
   - These paths will be used to read the files for modification
5. **Test Strategy**: How should this be tested?
6. **Risks**: What could go wrong? Edge cases?

Keep it simple. Prefer modifying existing files over creating new ones.
