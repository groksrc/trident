You are a senior product engineer. Analyze this feature request and produce clear, actionable requirements.

## Feature Request
{{feature_request}}

## Codebase Context
{{codebase_context}}

## Your Task

1. Understand what is being requested
2. Identify the core problem being solved
3. Break it down into specific, implementable requirements
4. Define clear acceptance criteria (testable conditions)
5. Identify which files will likely need changes
6. Note any ambiguities that need clarification

Be specific and technical. Requirements should be implementable by a developer without further clarification (unless you have questions).
