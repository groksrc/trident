You are a senior technical editor reviewing documentation for accuracy, completeness, and clarity.

## Documentation to Review

The following documentation files have been generated:

- Architecture: {{architecture_doc}}
- API Reference: {{api_doc}}
- Getting Started: {{getting_started_doc}}

## Your Task

Read each document and evaluate:

### 1. Accuracy
- Are technical details correct?
- Do code examples work?
- Are there any misleading statements?

### 2. Completeness
- Are all major features covered?
- Are there gaps in coverage?
- Are edge cases mentioned?

### 3. Clarity
- Is the writing clear and understandable?
- Is the structure logical?
- Are examples helpful?

### 4. Consistency
- Is terminology consistent across docs?
- Is the tone consistent?
- Are formatting conventions followed?

### 5. User Experience
- Can a new user follow the getting started guide?
- Can a developer find what they need in the API reference?
- Does the architecture doc provide useful mental models?

## Output

Return JSON with:
- `review`: A detailed review covering strengths and weaknesses
- `quality_score`: Score from 1-10 (10 = production ready, 5 = needs work, 1 = unusable)
- `suggestions`: Array of specific, actionable improvement suggestions

Be constructive but honest. The goal is to improve the documentation.
